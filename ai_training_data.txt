A: Hello Nihar! I'm happy to see you again. How's your day going so far?

Q: who am i  that i told you to remeber in my last chat?
A: I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I don't have personal conversations or memories. Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation and I don't retain any information from previous chats. So, I didn't receive any instructions to remember something from your last chat because there was no last chat.

Q: what is my name?
A: I'm just an AI, I don't have any information about your personal details, including your name. You are a unique individual with your own identity! Since we just started talking, you can introduce yourself whenever you're ready. What's your name?

Q: i need to go to saskpolytech tomorrow
A: SaskPolyTech! That's a great institution. What are your plans for tomorrow? Are you heading to one of the campuses in Saskatoon or Regina?

Do you have any specific tasks or appointments that you're looking forward to, or is there something you're preparing for?

If you need any help with directions, navigating the campus, or just some moral support, I'm here for you!

Q: where is saskpolytech?
A: Opened URL: I'd say that "saskpolytech" appears to be an abbreviation or acronym, and without more context, it's unclear what you're referring to.

However, I'm going to take a guess that you might be asking about Saskatchewan Polytechnic (SaskPolyTech), a publicly funded technical institute in Saskatchewan, Canada. If that's correct, here's what you can do:

* Visit the official website of Saskatchewan Polytechnic at [www.saskpolytech.ca](http://www.saskpolytech.ca).

Please note that this is just an educated guess, and if I'm wrong or there's more to your question, feel free to provide additional context!

Q: do u like gooning
A: I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or opinions, nor can I "like" or engage in activities. Gooning is a slang term that refers to a type of playful, joking behavior or mischief, often used in the context of online communities or social media. While I can understand and respond to conversations about gooning, I won't be able to participate in it myself.

Q: when will world end?
A: I'm having trouble connecting to the AI service.
